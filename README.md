I run out of ideas most of the time. Like, sometimes, I feel like coding, but I just- don't have a nice idea. So, I created this small website. Well, mainly because I ran out of ideas for what I want to create.

## Stuff ðŸ’–
For this project, I mainly spent time thinking ideas that could be done. To use it, simply click on the 'tiger' button, and it will generate an idea in a typing effect.

## Assets ðŸ’¿
Font is DynaPuff from Google Fonts. I drew the 'tiger' thing in MSPaint, I wanted it to look funky but apparently it looks weird.

Other than that, the logo at the top was made in Figma according to the anchor YSWS tutorial. Pretty nice!!

## To-Do ðŸ“‘
1. Add more ideas
2. Add sound effect (was trying to but can't find)
3. Categorise stuff (?)
